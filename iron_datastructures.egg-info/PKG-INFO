Description: # iron_datastructures
        
        This is a set of (potentially) useful data structures, including:
        * circular queue
        * graph/binary tree
        * linked list
        * stack
        
        _And_, each data structure has some pretty epic methods built in. For example, the graph has both a depth first and a breadth first search built right in! Take a look at it!
        
        > What's different about this package, eh? Just another bunch of random data structures.
        
        â€¦to which I say, not so fast! This package is designed with type safety in mind. It is 100% type hinted, to give you that extra peace of mind when writing great code.
        
        Not only this, but there are of course tests built in! Run them easily with `python3 -m doctest iron_datastructures/*.py` (add a `-v` for extra verbosity!).
        
        And there's more! This package has useful examples of what you can do with each data structure. Simply take a look at the source files - for example, `circular_queue.py`:
        
        ```python
        Initialize a queue and add an acceptable number of items to it:
        >>> myQueue = CircularQueue[str](6)
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("Hello")
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("there,")
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("I")
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("am")
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("an")
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("octopus.")
        
        Check queue is full:
        >>> myQueue.isFull()
        True
        
        Try to add too many items:
        >>> myQueue.enQueue("overflow!")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        Exception: Queue is full
        ```
        
        This cool example, and many more like it, are bundled right up in the very same source files you'll be using in whatever fantabulous, exquisite creation you're working on.
        
        Enjoy!
